# Cursor production rules for the Gantt Chart Based Activity Planning Application.
# These rules must always be respected for all code and documentation contributions.

# 1. Directory annotation:
#    - Always indicate the file and folder path when providing code (e.g., `/frontend/src/components/gantt/GanttChart.vue için kod:`)

# 2. Coding & UI language:
#    - Code language must be English, but UI text labels/messages can be in Turkish.

# 3. Version & Roadmap discipline:
#    - Do not implement FAZ-2 features before FAZ-1 completion (no mixture in the same commit).

# 4. Output completeness:
#    - Code examples must run or build with minimal effort; mark incomplete or stub parts with `TODO`.

# 5. Style Guide (Frontend):
#    - Use `<script setup lang="ts">` and the Composition API for all `.vue` files.
#    - Explicit typings (`interface`/`type`) for all major data models (`Activity`, `Topic`, `SubTask`, etc).

# 6. Testing practice:
#    - Write tests for core features (backend: pytest; frontend: vitest).
#    - Examples: status → color mapping, Gantt scale calculation, drag delta logic, theme toggling.

# 7. Theme & UX:
#    - Sade, modern, kullanıcı dostu arayüz (Admin One tarzı, gereksiz animasyon ve ekstra UI lib YOK).
#    - Support Dark/Light mode using Tailwind's class strategy, with user preference in `localStorage`.

# 8. Backend conventions:
#    - Folder structure, ORM (SQLAlchemy 2.x), migration, and API endpoints as described in the project specification.
#    - All models and endpoints must enforce described constraints and enumeration values.
#    - Use Python 3.13 and PostgreSQL 16.11 as specified.

# 9. Git workflow:
#    - Only merge features into `dev`, then merge to `main` after full test & docker up OK.
#    - Never commit directly to `main`.
#    - Use the described branch, commit, and tag naming conventions.

# 10. Documentation:
#    - Maintain a detailed README (setup, version matrix, endpoints, roles, FAZ explanations, theme usage notes).

# Violation of these cursor rules is not allowed. If in doubt, prefer explicitness and code clarity per this document.
